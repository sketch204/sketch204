Hi! I'm Inal. I'm a software developer with a passion for iOS. I've done iOS development for over 5 years now, and for the past year I've been picking up backend development with NodeJS, Express and JavaScript.

I'm also very passionate about music, and have been learning to play musical instruments, specifically guitar and drums, for a number of years now.

If you want to chat about anything, feel free to shoot an email to hello@inal.dev
